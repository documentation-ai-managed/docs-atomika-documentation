## Keep Updated

Documentation becomes less valuable as it ages. Establish processes to keep content current.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Set Review Schedules" default-open="false">
    Schedule regular reviews of documentation, especially after product updates or feature changes.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Monitor Usage" default-open="false">

## Technical Best Practices

Follow these technical guidelines to ensure your documentation is maintainable and accessible.

- **Use Consistent Formatting**: Establish style guides for headings, code blocks, and lists
- **Include Metadata**: Add tags, categories, and version information to pages
- **Optimize for Search**: Use descriptive titles and include relevant keywords
- **Ensure Accessibility**: Write alt text for images and ensure color contrast

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate Links" icon="link">
    Regularly check that all internal and external links work correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Examples" icon="play">
    Verify that code examples and tutorials work as described.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Version Control" icon="git-branch">
    Track documentation changes alongside code changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Following these best practices will help you create documentation that is valuable, maintainable, and user-friendly. Remember that good documentation is an ongoing process, not a one-time effort.
