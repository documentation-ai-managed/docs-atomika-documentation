socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  updateDocument(data.changes);
};
      ````
      ````javascript
const updateDoc = async (docId, changes) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/docs/${docId}`, {

## Version Control

Keep track of all changes to your documentation with our built-in version control system. Every edit is saved as a new version, allowing you to revert to previous states if needed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Versioning" icon="clock">
    Every save creates a new version automatically, with timestamps and author information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Version Comparison" icon="git-compare">
    Compare different versions to see exactly what changed between edits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rollback" icon="undo">
    Easily revert to any previous version if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Branching" icon="git-branch">
    Create branches for major updates or experimental content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">
